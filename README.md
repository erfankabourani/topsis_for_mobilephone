# TOPSIS for Mobile Phone Ranking
This repository contains a Python implementation of the TOPSIS algorithm specifically designed for ranking and evaluating mobile phones based on multiple criteria. TOPSIS is a multi-criteria decision-making method that compares alternatives by their similarity to an ideal solution and provides a ranking order.

# What is TOPSIS?
TOPSIS (Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) is a decision-making technique that assesses alternatives based on multiple criteria. It aims to find the best alternative that closely resembles the ideal solution while simultaneously avoiding the negative aspects of the alternatives. TOPSIS calculates a relative score for each alternative and provides a ranking order based on these scores.

# About this Repository
This repository contains the following components:

topsis_Exercise.ipynp: The main Python script that implements the TOPSIS algorithm for mobile phone ranking. It takes input data, criteria weights, and impact factors to calculate the TOPSIS scores and generate a ranked list of mobile phones.

topsis_Exercise.xlsx: A sample input data file that includes information about various mobile phones and their performance on different criteria. You can replace this file with your own dataset for evaluation.

README.md: The documentation file that provides detailed instructions on how to use the TOPSIS implementation for mobile phone ranking. It includes information on input data format, criteria weight and impact factor selection, and interpreting the results.

Getting Started
To use this TOPSIS implementation for mobile phone ranking, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine or download the ZIP file.

Install the required dependencies, if any, mentioned in the README.md file.

Prepare your input data file in the specified format or replace the provided data.csv file with your own dataset.

Open the topsis_Exercise.ipynp script and modify any necessary parameters or settings according to your requirements.

Run the topsis_Exercise.ipynp script using Python. The script will process the input data, calculate the TOPSIS scores, and generate a ranked list of mobile phones based on their performance.

Review the results and interpret the output to make informed decisions about mobile phone selection based on the given criteria.

Contributions and Issues
Contributions to enhance the functionality, performance, or usability of this TOPSIS implementation are welcome. If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvements, please open an issue on the repository's GitHub page.

Happy mobile phone evaluation using TOPSIS!
